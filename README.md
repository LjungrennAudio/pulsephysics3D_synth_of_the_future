# pulsephysics3D_synth_of_the_future
 this is a ridiculously ambitious synth project - probably hopeless...

ran in parallel with:

# flex-vintage-va-synth-
flexible architecture vintage emulaton virtual analogue synth optimised by machine learning for low cpu

c++ based virtual analgue synthh
flexible architecture concept involves multiple different modular blocks of analogue circuit models
from input transformers through exciter sources, wavguides, resonators, effects, spatial and output
all with parametric control and details like temperature variation, tolerance variation and age variation
optimised using machine learning to run on very low cpu in low latency reel time high quality audio
up to 192khz 24bit audio, 128bit 2.5 - 4ghz cpu with vector arithmetic capability
ideal tech option is arm cortex 5x series employing helium tech to use vector and dsp and ai nural net machine learning to run code that competres with state of the art custom fpga synths but using an ic that costs approx $15 from commercial cell phone sources
arm cortex are widely available, very well supported for open source dev tools, support common coding languages like c++ and py as employed in code intended for use by this project
likely long lifetime support and back compatibility to ensure no fear of obsolesence
current equivalent technologies employed by people like woflram modelling are relaitvely slow/cpu intensive, companies like nord/novation/modal/stuiologic/sequential/roland/waldorf employ either custom fpga ic's that are prohibitively expensive or relatively inefficient algorythms that limit total options for architecture/polyphony ect.
by mploying the helium vector arithmetic/dsp/ai machine learning capabilities of the latest range of arm cortex mcu's i suspect it is possible to compete with these high end big corporations without having immense resourcess by using the best math and optimisation of code currently available
much of the research stems from stanford ccrma and their alumni - especially the work of  Julius Smith, Kurt Werner and Jatin Chowdhury.
further inspiration has been drawn from a number of developments involving various areas of research into signal processing, physical modelling, acoustics, nrueral learning/ai, c++/py and supercollider/csound/modellica/wolfram technologies
the original two sources of inspiration that triggered the whol concept were the works of emilie gillet's eurorck modules and curtis roads granular synthesis techniues, specifically pulsar synthesis.
everything used so far in evry single was has been open source, freely available research apaers/journals/conference proceedings/books/university course syllabi etc., and dev toosl amde by manufactures themselves specific to arm cortex, risc-v, C++, py etc.
this whole project will be open source and encouraged to be forked, modified, expanded and extended as much as possible - its mostly just an exerise in seeing hwat can be done without $100,000,000 of large corporate synth company bacing up everything
hopefully itll be possible to make something even more advanced and creative and cool than the absolute best on the market right now yet be compatible with entirely open sorce software and dev tools ect. torun on cpu technology that costs no more than $10 - $15 per processor yet will be safe from obsolesence!

5 weeks of research, reading, learning and note taking in so far
ive gone from basic knowlege if synthesis, analogue electronics and digital electronics to basics of C and py code, fourier/norm space/vector/complex calculus type math and am now diving deeper into nerual net/ai/machine learrning...
