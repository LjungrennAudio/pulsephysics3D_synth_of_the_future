General Modeling Procedure used in elements:
- Formulate a state-space model: exciter -> dual delayline -> fir dispersion/iir damping filter -> add extras like nonlinearities etc.
In the linear case, diagonalize the state-space model to obtain the modal representation: kinda not really actually follwed this procedure
Implement isolated modes as second-order filters (``biquads''): filters are caled etc. but not made into a integrated single function model.
Implement quasi-harmonic mode series as digital waveguides: again - more of a delay > filt > fb x64 instead of integrated function for efficiency.

i plan to:

instead of feed from badly scanned 8bit granulised samples that are then poorly interpolated and mixed, use the pulsar synth as exciter source

improve waveguide string model	- upgrade allpass filters in delay line
				- upgrade interpolation methids in delay line
				- maybe increas sample rate of delay line

				- improve fir disperion filter and its intepolation
				- improve iir damping filter and its interpolation

				- add all kinds nonlinearit custom tweaks for more creative/organic/intersting behaviour

derive integrated function for above into a synthesis body model.
derive a number [10?15?] of different bdy models to morph between:

feeds into filterbank for modal.

this newer filterbank https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/8/1/96
bit adapt to make less special analysis/reconstruct bank - purely synthesis.
then will use as a better filterbank than the one used in elements.

also plan to add 3 highest gain modes calced sum/dif pairs for efficient nonlinearity modelling.

using below as other input:


BLEX analytic pluck synthesis
https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/writing/2021/analytic-pluck/#the-exponential-frequency-click
informed by BLIT/BLEP/BLAMP synthesis
https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/courses/2020/307/week5/bandlimited.html

to excite another of the improved waveguide based synths.




this then goes out to a simplfied and adapted version of the hyperspherical mapping of multiple mixspaces for

mid/side, 3 band eq and gain.




this then feeda into a spatial mapping spectrum model to give cool effects


and on
