Two functions f(x) and g(x) are orthogonal over the interval a <= x <= b with weighting function w(x) if

 <f(x)|g(x)> = int_a^bf(x)g(x)w(x)dx = 0. 	

If, in addition,

		int_a^b[f(x)]^2w(x)dx    =   1

		int_a^b[g(x)]^2w(x)dx    =   1    then,	

the functions f(x) and g(x) are said to be orthonormal.

a Fourier series is an expansion of a periodic function f(x) in terms of an infinite sum of sines and cosines.
Fourier series make use of the orthogonality relationships of the sine and cosine functions.

the computation and study of Fourier series is known as harmonic analysis.
it is extremely useful as a way to break up an arbitrary periodic function into a set of simple terms that can be plugged in  and solved individually.

these simplified terms can then recombined to obtain the solution to the original problem or an approximation to it to whatever accuracy is desired or practical. 
examples of successive approximations to common functions using Fourier series are illustrated below.

An ordinary differential equation, ODE, is an equality involving a function and its derivatives. An ODE of order n is an equation of the form F(x,y,y^',...,y^(n)) = 0.  

seriously, thats all you need or want to know...

the 'superposition principle' states that for a linear homogeneous ODE, if y_1(x) and y_2(x) are solutions, then so is y_1(x)+y_2(x).
