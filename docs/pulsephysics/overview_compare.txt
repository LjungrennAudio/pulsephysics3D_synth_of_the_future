exciters
- blend of bow/blow/strike in complex wy to get quite a variety of near most kinds of real instrument input from only few knobs.

tube
- listens to certain exciter inputs in quite clever way
- very complex intepretation of pressure in resulting in change of pressure over time alltering tonging/reed response etc, feedinng back to change resulting response etc.
- variable tube length n nonlinearities n filters n stuff affected by geometry/position
- all varies with tuning/brightness/damping/geometry
- not quite as advanced as string model re comb/allpass below but still some clever variation.
- spatial

string
- listens to dif combo of exciter inputs in dif equally clever way
- complex interpretation of inuput pressure to get bowing/plucking stuff
- variable stiffness/stretch n nonlinearities n stuff affected by geometry/position
- all varies with tuning/brightness/damping/geometry
- mixes fir/iir and allpass/comb to get complex string model with variety from nonlinearities and controls.
- spatial

resonator
- strings in
- tuning results in modes + harmonics + partials
- look up table dictates how trictly adhheres to notes in scale
- runs as many x model as it as computing for
- varies with tuning/brightness/damping/position/geometry
- nonlinearites mostly from tuning stuff via extra 1024 delay line fractoined for partials

makes seed from serial nmber, uses it to randomes coefficients in involving geometry/position/brightness/damping/tuning/verb/etc.

out.


seems as much to be about allowing entire thing to be controlled by the tuning plus geom/pos/damp/bright.
as it  is about processing power - i.e. keeping it easy torun real time parametric control with like 5 knobs.
