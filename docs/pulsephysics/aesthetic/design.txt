i honestly over the past decade have deeply become of the view that ux is more mportant than anything else
i guess is like dif between a nice smooth oiled wood neck on an intrument and one wrapped inbarbed wire
it ight look cool af but you never actually play the brbe wired guitar.
hence ts been two monttha and i'm still working on the the ui of synth first and formost am designing
yes, engine or archeitecture or deised sund etc. might seem to be key apporaches - but tho they dictate certain aspects of design, fundamentally like anything its aleays a trianlge or whatever of competeing aspects - you can favor/focus on something but it always means compromising elsewherre
the real art of design/engineering is to get as many of the normally opposing 'polygon' points all pullling out to optimal without compromsing elsehwere - but each exta feature of major importance - keyb/no keyb, portability price, massproducable, aesthetics, etc. - the moe there aree thte gretae rchance something s suboptimal and the greater harder the tals of making it all gud or at least woking so that the compromises arent a huge issue for the chose setup
