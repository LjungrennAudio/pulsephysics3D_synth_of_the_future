by far best option to condesnsed many complex routings into a quick selectc choice for me is ableton's
[07:00]
but - it limits to those routings offered
[07:03]
what if the blocks are the fixed blocks avail - but instead you choose somehow quickly between either strainght line, one-into-two, two-into-one, two-morph [two-in/one-out or two-in/then add split-to-two], fm opions e.g. vertical block fms above/below, ring mod so 'x' situation, etc.!

thoughts?

4 screens, knob to scroll/button to sel or push-knob to scroll-sel
3 knobs fo knob per function control, choose params - e.g. filter cutoff, res, env dep.

finally, on right, somehow something like this for the myriad of routing and mod options
but this aesthetic/colourscheme

[now combine]
this is where am at so far...
