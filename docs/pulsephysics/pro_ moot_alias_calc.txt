to wavefold it and then populate a wavetable with resultant waveforms

these waveforms are called 'pulsarets', refered to mathermaticaly as 'w'.

pulsar synthesis involves generating a tone, a 'pulsetrain'.

this pulsetrain is a string of repeated blocks called pulsars. 

each pulsar has duration p = [d + s]

where 'd' is the period of a pulsaret, 'w' [the waveforms we populated the wavetable with]
and 's' is the period of a length of silence [the purpose of which will become apparent]  

------

so, we're producing this tone by spewing out a string of pulsars, 'p' :

[p] : [p] : [p] : [p] : ...

and since pulsars are calculated form p = [d + s], we have:

[d + s] : [d + s] : [d + s] : [d + s] : ...

this value of 'd', the period of our pulsaret waveform 'w' is the _duty cycle_ of our pulsar.

------

we can therefore define the frequency of the tone corresponding to the repetition preiod our pulsars are emitted at as:

fp = 1/p		[in the original paper on this typical range for 'fp' was given as 1hz to 5khz]

and like wise the frequncey corresponding to the duty cycle of the pulsar elements of our pulsechain tone as:

fd = 1/d		[in the original paper on this typical range for 'fd' was given as 80hz to 10khz]

------

if 'w' were a single cycle of a sinewave then sweeping the duty cycle, 'd', of the pulsar in a continuous fashion results in an effect akin to sweeping a resonant filter across the tone from the pulsetrain created by the string of pulsars emitted. 

[by keeping d:s ratio constant, 'p', i.e. overall frequency is preserved, varying 'd' alters timbre - so we can vary duty cycle, i.e. change that filter type formant effect independent of pitch. using the period of silence clever, huh! - told you i'd get round to it...]


so:
:: we can change the waveform 'w', drawn from our generated wavetable - it can be anything we want, anything we generate or input to aux. in!

:: we have an envelope, 'v ~' that shapes the waveform 'w' we drew from the wavetable we generated - this envelope can be any waveform, audio even - we can do convolution!

:: we have an envelope, 'd ~' that shapes the duty cycle, 'd' resulting in a formant effect akin to filtering - this envelope can be any waveform, audio even - we can do convolution again here!.

:: and we can modulate the PulWM - pulsewidth of the pulsar, getting the effects of PWM kinda stuff on a pulsewave, but, it works on any waveform - and with PulWM, not only does d = 0 still generate an audible signal, but even p < d produces an audible signal!
when the fundamental period cuts off the duty cycle of the pulsaret, we just have to choose what occurs, either we accept a sharp cutoff and hence a high edge factor or implement a user-controlled crossfade! so we can vary the degree of PulWM crossfade, 'cf' too.

:: if the fundamental period, defined as the rate of pulsar emission independent of duty cycle, i.e. then, the duty cycle always completes even when it drops below the fundamental frequency - whenever the fundamental period expires it spawns a new pulsar - although because d > p resulting in multiple pulsars overlapping with others whose duty cycle have yet to complete, it means that as 'd' increases the number of overlapping pulsars generated continues to increase.
so, if we engage this 'overlapped' or OPulWM, generally, because OPulWM results in a high degree of phase cancellation across the various overlaps, the sound is more subtle and hence there is a distinct difference in sound when employing OPulWM. more new sounds!

------

that's 5 dif ways to vary timbre, one of which, since it uses the option of an aux. input for wave source - which can also supply our envelope shapes - when it then has it's pitch adjusted by the knob controlling frequency [pulsar emission rate], 'fp', and then shaped by a final output envelope we get a shaped excitatory signal to feed into the modal synthesiser portion of ths thing, that we have control over pitch/shape/timbre.

'w ~' envelope,  'v ~' envelope, 'd ~' envelope, PulWM, 'cf', turn on OPulWM, size of 'v ~' envelope, size of 'd ~' envelope, alter pitch 'fp' and change the attack of the impulse resulting from enveloping this pulsetrain 

------

The nature of digital methods, and the overall unpredictability of non-linear systems introduces potential for baaaaadaliasing:


since the lowest frequency, according to the paper, 'fp' is set to tends to be around 1hz, and the max, 5khz - along with the fact that i suspect this exciter waveform doesnt always have to be of the highest quality audio;


since aliasing occurs when the highest frequencies produced by a digital system exceed the Nyquist frequency: ?

according to Nyquist theory highest accurately representable frequency is half the sample rate:
Nyquist frequency defines upper limit: ?


low pass filter: could help?

highest frequency that the system is capable of generating: unknown?
overall amount of harmonic distortion: unknown?

therefore, extent of necessary oversampling: unkown?


the pitch of the pulsar synth, i.e. frequency = pulsar emission rate = fp = 1/p = 1/(d + s) is all controlled by us/known at all given times.

tbh, if 5khz is all we gotta worry about, we ok, right?

plus, due aesthetic judgment and the fact we using this form of microsound/granualar type synthesis for the very readon its poor qual and good for exciting a modal synth resonator...
