- flexible to extreme
- user loadable as much as possible
- true future proof - all formats, models, wavforms, etc. etc. must be so mathematical they can be endlessly added/upgraded/exported/imported/open sourced etc.
- user editable
- customisable
- make full use of available power but easily upgradeable or newer version compatible as more power/complex/memory/etc.
- support development in further nonlins, detail, new math, etc.
- therefore allow for ai/machine learning and future devs of?
- non-prescriptive
- is c++/py future proof?
- must be vst3/hardware compat. is browser capable future too?
- ir somehow as opt? maybe ability to input ir and convert to wdf optimised by machine learn?
>> all ir/env/s.cycle/convolve/sample/etc. as universal format, future proof > 24 bit 44khz wav?

key future tech is machine learn and browser?

- even 2.6ghz 4 core/?ram @ 192khz/24bit too much?
- is usb c future proof enough?
is xlr combi future proof?
- is 3.5 for analogue cv future proof?

is 4 16/9 widecreen type display right? 5 more 4:3?

ROUTING - rail shunting yard?
MODULATION - 5th control block?/mod select?
