General Modeling Procedure

Formulate a state-space model.
In the linear case, diagonalize the state-space model to obtain the modal representation.
Implement isolated modes as second-order filters (``biquads'').
Implement quasi-harmonic mode series as digital waveguides.



a digital waveguide is defined as a bidirectional delay line - two delay lines,one for each direction, each delay line contains a sampled acoustic traveling wave.
since the vibration of an ideal string can be described as the sum of two traveling waves going in opposite directions, a bidirectional delay line (a digital waveguide) can model any one-dimensional linear acoustic system - such as a string or pipe etc.
in real acoustic strings and bores, the 1D waveguides exhibit some loss and dispersion, it is convenient to have separate damping and dispersion filters in a model since the damping filter tends to be significantly less demanding than the dispersion filter.

If a traveling wave attenuates as it propagates, with the same attenuation factor at each frequency, the attenuation can be simulated by a simple scaling of the delay line output.
For accurate acoustic modeling, it is usually necessary to replace the constant scale factor g by a digital filter G(z) which implements frequency-dependent attenuation, a linear time-invariant (LTI) filter can provide an independent attenuation factor at each frequency.
usually can be a lower-order IIR filter.

wave-propagation medium is said to be dispersive if the speed of wave propagation is not the same at all frequencies
As a result, a propagating wave shape will ``disperse'' (change shape) as its various frequency components travel at different speeds. Dispersive propagation in one direction can be supplied by a filter in the basic feedback loop, with inharmonicity coefficient B or 'stretch factor'.

an input signal interacts with the state of the system at one point along the waveguide it only depends on the ``incoming state'' (traveling-wave components) and the driving input signal the interaction depends only on the amplitude of the simulated physical variable (such as string velocity or displacement).
incoming amplitude is formed as the sum of the incoming traveling-wave components.

geometry solved?
Applying the inverse warping to the parametric resonator via a first-order allpass filter, the time duration of the high-frequency modes is extended while the low-frequency modes are contracted in time duration. Thus, the modal decay times show less of a spread versus frequency.

nonlinearities:
Since longitudinal waves travel an order of magnitude faster than transverse waves, this coupling gives rise to high-frequency inharmonic overtones (corresponding to longitudinal modes of vibration) in the sound.

there are hints in emilie's setup jat there's 64 strings, 8 bowed strings and a tube model - not certain tho:

suspect i spied some tweaks such as:
