\section{Derivation of Shift Theory}
we'll start by going back to some basics and following through the derivation of Shift Theory for the continuous Foruier transform function. assuming basic quadratic funtions aren't too advanced;

there's also convenient links to the derivations of, and implementation of:
\ref{the sinusoid function}
\ref{the DFT}
\ref{Euler's Identity}
\ref{De Moivre's Theorem}


\begin{theorem}[Quadratic Formula]
\label{Quadratic Formula}

A root of a polynomial is a zero of the corresponding polynomial function. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial of degree \n\ has \n\ complex roots, counted with their multiplicities.

the quadratic formula allows us to express the quadratic polynomial \[ p(x) = x^{2} +4 \] in terms of its roots as 

		\[ p(x) = (x + 2j)(x - 2j) \]
\end{theorem}


We can think of these as ``imaginary roots'' in the sense that square roots of negative numbers don't really exist, or we can extend the concept of ``roots'' to allow for complex numbers, that is, numbers of the form

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
						\zbox {z = x + jy}
\end{equation}
where \x\ and \y\ are real numbers and the algebraic object \begin{equation} \label{eq:2} \[ j \triangleq \sqrt{-1} \end{equation}.

note: for complex numbers polynomials can always be factored completely.


the following derivations will assume some prior knowledge again but quick ref links to the derivations/equations used are below:

\href{63:https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/mdft/Sinusoids.html}{the sinusoid function}
\href{64:https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/mdft/DFT.html}{the DFT}
\href{65:https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/mdft/Euler_s_Identity_I.html}{Euler's Identity}
\href{66:https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/mdft/Direct_Proof_De_Moivre_s.html}{De Moivre's Theorem}



\begin{theorem}[Continuous FT Shift Theorem]
when \x(t)\ is a general sinusoid at frequency \omega, noting that the radian frequency \omega is equal to the time derivative of the instantaneous phase of the sinusoid \begin{equation} \label{eq:3} \frac{d}{dt} (\omega t + \phi) = \omega \end{equation}

the shift theorem for Fourier transforms states that delaying a signal \x(t)\ by \tau seconds multiplies its Fourier transform by \label{eq:4} e^{-j\omega\tau}:

(in which \j\ \triangleq \ref{eq:2})

	FT_{\omega}(S\textscale[0.8]{HIFT}_{\tau}(x)) \triangleq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t-\tau)e^{-j\omega\tau}dt

	(define \label{eq:5} \sigma = t-\tau)
     
						      = \int_{-infty}^{\infty} x(\sigma)e^{-j\omega(\sigma+\tau)}d\sigma			
					     
						      = e^{-j\omega\tau} \int_{-infty}^{\infty} x(\sigma)e^{-j\omega\sigma}d\sigma 
						   	     
						      \triangleq e^{-j\omega\tau} X(\omega)
				
				thus
					    
				     \zbox {x(t-\tau) \longleftrightarrow e^{-j\omega\tau} X(\omega) \label{Shift Theorem} }
				

			   	bearing in mind that \ref{the DFT}, X(\omega_k), gives us the transform kernel:
					  
				e^{-j\omega_{k}t_{n}} = \cos(\omega_{k}t_{n}) - j\sin(\omega_{k}t_{n})
\end{equation}	   



\section{Pulse Trains}[Pulse Trains]
now we switch from the derivation of Shift Theorem over to the mathematic of Pulse Trains:


\begin{theorem}[The Continuous-Time Impulse]:
an impulse in continuous time must have ``zero width'' and unit area under it. One definition is

\label{continuous-time impulse}		\omega(t)  \triangleq   \lim_{\tringle \to 0} 	\left\{																		\begin{array}{rl}
											frac{1}{\triangle}, 0 \leq t \leq \triangle,\\
											0, otherwise \right.\\
											\end{array} \right. 

also, An impulse can be similarly defined as the limit of any pulse shape which maintains unit area and approaches zero width at time 0. As a result, the impulse under every definition has the so-called sifting property under integration,

				\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\omega(t)dt=f(0),


provided \f(t)\ is continuous at t=0. This is often taken as the defining property of an impulse, allowing it to be defined in terms of non-vanishing function limits such as

				\omega(t) \triangleq \lim_{\Omega \to \infty} \fract{\sin{\Omega t)}{\pi t}


(noting, that fract{\sin(\Omega t)}{\pi t} is in \mathnormal{L_2} but not \mathnormal{L_1} .)

an impulse is not a function in the usual sense, so it is called instead a distribution or _generalized function_. (it is still commonly called a "delta function", however, despite the misnomer.)
\end{theorem}



\begin{theorem}[Impulse Trains]:
The impulse signal \delta(t) has a constant Fourier transform \ref{the DFT}:

		     FT_{f}(\delta) \triangleq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(t)e^{-j\fract{2}{\pi}ft}dt=1  \forallf \in \mathbb{R}


an impulse train can be defined as a sum of shifted impulses:

\label{Sum of Pulses}	\psi_{P}(t) \triangleq \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-mP)			


Here, \P\ is the period of the impulse train, in seconds i.e., the spacing between successive impulses. The \P\-periodic impulse train can also be defined as

		        \psi_{P}(t) = \fract{1}{P}\Ш(\fract{t}{P})

	
where where \Ш\ is the symbol 'shah' for an impulse train or Tate-Shafarevich group:

\label{Impulse Train}	      Ш(t) \triangleq \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-m)					


note that the scaling by \1/P\ in \ref{Impulse Train} is necessary to maintain unit area under each impulse.
as a result, it can now be shown that
`						
		       \zbox {Ш(t) \longleftrightarrow Ш(f).}


that is, the Fourier transform of the normalized impulse train \Ш(t)\ is exactly the same impulse train \Ш(f)\ in the frequency domain, where  \t\ denotes time in seconds and \f\ denotes frequency in \Hz\.

by the scaling theorem \ref{footnoteB.4},

		   Ш(\fract{t}{P}) \longleftrightarrow PШ(Pf),


so that the $ P$ -periodic impulse-train defined in (B.46) transforms to

	     	       \psi_{P}(t) = \fract{1}{P}\Ш(\fract{t}{P}) \longleftrightarrow Ш(Pf) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(Pf-m)

			 	   = \fract{1}{P} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(f-\fract{m}{P})

			 	   = \fract{1}{P}\psi_{\fract{1}{P}}(f) = \psi_P(f)


thus, the \P\-periodic impulse train transforms to a \(1/P)\-periodic impulse train, in which each impulse contains area \1/P\:

	       \psi_P(f) \triangleq FT_{f}(\psi_P) = \fract{1}{P}\psi_{\fract{1}{P}}(f)

\begin{Proof}
Let's set up a limiting construction by defining
\end{Proof}



so that $ \lim_{M\to\infty}\,\raisebox{0.8em}{\rotatebox{-90}{\resizebox{1em}{1em}{\ensuremath{\exists}}}}_M(t)=\,\raisebox{0.8em}{\rotatebox{-90}{\resizebox{1em}{1em}{\ensuremath{\exists}}}}(t)$ . We may interpret $ \,\raisebox{0.8em}{\rotatebox{-90}{\resizebox{1em}{1em}{\ensuremath{\exists}}}}_M(t)$ as a sampled rectangular pulse of width $ 2M$ seconds (yielding $ 2M+1$ samples).By linearity of the Fourier transform and the shift theorem (§B.5), we readily obtain the transform of $ \,\raisebox{0.8em}{\rotatebox{-90}{\resizebox{1em}{1em}{\ensuremath{\exists}}}}_M(t)$ to be






Using the closed form of a geometric series,



with $ r=e^{-j\pi f}$ , we can write this as	





where we have used the definition of $ \hbox{asinc}$ given in Eq.(3.5) of §3.1. As we would expect from basic sampling theory, the Fourier transform of the sampled rectangular pulse is an aliased sinc function. Figure 3.2 illustrates one period $ M\cdot\hbox{asinc}_M(\omega)$ for $ M=11$ .

The proof can be completed by expressing the aliased sinc function as a sum of regular sinc functions, and using linearity of the Fourier transform to distribute $ \hbox{\sc FT}_f$ over the sum, converting each sinc function into an impulse, in the limit, by §B.13:







by §B.13. Note that near $ f=0,2,4,\ldots$ , we have





as $ M\to\infty$ , as shown in §B.13. Similarly, near $ f=1,3,5,\ldots$ , we have



as $ M\to\infty$ . Finally, we expect that the limit for non-integer $ f$ can be neglected since



whenever $ n<a\leq b<n+1$ and $ n$ is some integer, as implied by §B.13.

Using a similar limiting construction as before,





a direct inverse-Fourier transform calculation gives



thus the peaks occur every $ P$ seconds and reach height $ (2L+1)/P$ . Also the peak widths, measured between zero crossings, are $ P/(2L+1)$ , so the area under each peak is of order 1 in the limit as $ L\to\infty$ . 

remembering that the shift theorem for inverse Fourier transforms is $ e^{j\nu t}x(t) \;\leftrightarrow\;
X(f-\nu)$ , and $ {\textscale[0.8] IFT}_t(\delta)=1/(2\pi)$ ,


\footnote{B.4{\texttt{https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Differentiation_Theorem.html}}




now the real fun; here we have a real cute bandlimited impulse:

			( 2pix - e^-k/2(k cdot sin(pix) + 2pix cdot cos(pix)) ) / ( k^2 + (2pix)^2 )

give it linearly increasing k and you get a beautiful pluck impulse :) perfectly pitched alias free!

hardware (analogue) audio effects as well as knowledge of their parameters and how they change the sound is crucial when controlling digital audio effects. this often presents barriers for musicians and casual users in the application of effects. these users are more accustomed to describing the desired sound verbally or using examples, rather than understanding and configuring low-level signal processing parameters. this paper addresses
this issue by providing a novel control method for audio effects - one that automates it by dynamic [?] function.

The Tonal Interval Space is an extended type of pitch space that represents human perceptions of pitches, chords and keys as well as music theory principles as distances. Multi-level pitch configurations are represented in the space as 12-dimensional Tonal Interval Vectors (TIVs). Inspired by Euler's Tonnetz, Chew’s Spiral Array, and Harte et al.'s 6-dimensional Tonal Centroid Space, the Tonal Interval Space refines the intervallic relations of the above-mentioned spaces by an increased numbers of dimensions. 
In this paper, we present TIV.lib, an open-source library for the content-based tonal description of musical audio signals. Its main novelty relies on the perceptually-inspired Tonal Interval Vector space based on the Discrete Fourier transform, from which multiple instantaneous and global representations, descriptors and metrics are computed — e.g., harmonic change, dissonance, diatonicity, and musical key.
